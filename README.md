# This is the repository my Fall 202 Web Development course. Use this repo exclusively to follow along with any work or code done in class.

## About me!

### Prior to this course, I've made some small, personal projects (mainly designing small websites, so I have a decent amount of experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript now!) and a large-scale video game demo via Unreal Engine. This project was done over the course of a few months for Software Engineering and consisted of a team of 6 of us. I really enjoyed working together with my classmates and was extremely grateful for the opportunity to be put into the leadership position for our group. We got an A!

### I already have some experience with the frontend design of websites because of the small projects I worked on over the summer, so I'm really looking forward to expanding my knowledge with backend and database work.
